Requirements:
-------------

javabridge>=1.0.11
numpy        
glob
pydot
pyparsing
GraphViz

Installation:
-------------

Should suffice with doing:

 python setup.py install

Or using pip to install:
 
 pip install git+https://github.com/bd2kccd/PyTetrad

Needless to say, no installation is needed just to use the module. A mere:

 import pydot

should do it, provided that the directory containing the modules is on Python
module search path.
